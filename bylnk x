Steps to Set Up GSM Connection in Blynk
1. SIM Card Setup
Use a GSM SIM card with active data service.
Disable the SIM's PIN code using a phone before inserting it into the module.
Ensure the SIM has enough credit/data balance for GPRS.
2. Connection Settings in Code
In the code, you're using the BlynkSimpleSerial.h library to connect Blynk with GSM.
The SoftwareSerial object (gsm) defines the TX and RX pins used to communicate with the SIM800L module.
3. Blynk App Configuration
Virtual Pins: Assign appropriate virtual pins to your widgets. Based on the example:
V1: Soil Moisture Percentage (Gauge or Value Display widget).
V2: Water Level in cm (Gauge or Value Display widget).
V3: Pump Status (LED or Button widget).
V4: Manual Pump Control (Switch widget).
Add Widgets:
Open the Blynk app.
Create a project and copy the auth token.
Add widgets and assign the virtual pins as listed above.
4. Wiring SIM800L
Connect the SIM800L module to your Arduino using the following pinout:
VCC: 4Vâ€“4.2V power supply (check your module specifications).
GND: Ground.
RX: Connect to Arduino's TX (e.g., pin 10 in the code).
TX: Connect to Arduino's RX (e.g., pin 11 in the code).
Use a stable power source; SIM800L modules can have high power requirements.
Optional: Debugging GSM Connection
Check Network Registration:

The GSM module will register to the network automatically. If it fails, ensure:
Correct APN settings for your mobile network (this is often not required unless you manually set it).
Adequate signal strength in your area.
Serial Monitor:

Open the Arduino Serial Monitor to check if the GSM module successfully connects to Blynk.
Blynk Connection Workflow
The GSM module establishes a GPRS connection to the internet using the mobile network.
Blynk's GSM library communicates with the Blynk cloud server using the GPRS connection.
Widgets on the app display the sensor data and allow remote control over the relay.
This connection type is straightforward, provided the GSM module has a strong signal and sufficient power. Let me know if you need help troubleshooting GSM connectivity or setting up widgets in Blynk.
